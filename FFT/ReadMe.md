# Calculates Fourier transform and its inverse using FFT algorithm in single dimension
1. size should be in 2^n
2. data is in format of complex numbers as shown in .h file. Please make data in that format
3. use left bitwise operator to determine size in 2^n format
4. always use dataPrep module to pass data to FFT.cpp to satisfy all pre-requesites
5. or write ur own !!!!!!
